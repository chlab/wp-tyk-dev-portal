# Troubleshooting

## Problems with Guest Additions of VirtualBox

In case you run into problems with the guest additions of VirtualBox, run the following command in the box:

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup

You should always be able to login to the box (`vagrant ssh`) with user vagrant / password vagrant.

## Re-Provisioning an existing Vagrant-Box

You might get the following error when you try to reprovision an exisiting Vagrant-Box:

`Shared folders that Chef requires are missing on the virtual machine. ...`

If this happens just execute the following command:

    $ rm .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/synced_folders
    $ vagrant reload --provision

A workaround for this issue has been added to the Vagrantfile. You should now be able to just run `vagrant reload --provision`

## Permission problems with NFS mount

You might get errors with the permissions of the shared folder when using NFS:

```
chown: changing ownership of ‘/var/www’: Operation not permitted
```

This is a [known issues of PuPHPet](https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/wiki/Shared-Folder:-Permission-Denied) and can be solved by editing the Vagrant file. Add the following to the `config.vm.synced_folder` option:

```
:linux__nfs_options => ["rw","no_root_squash","no_subtree_check"]
```
